        I am a Principal Engineer with two decades of experience architecting and scaling
        critical software infrastructure, from low-level embedded systems to
        enterprise-wide distributed security. Currently at Amazon, I lead the technical
        strategy for the company's core non-person access control solution,
        driving architectural decisions that impact thousands of services and millions of requests.

        My professional journey spans from developing electronics and FPGA design tools
        at <a href="https://ni.com">National Instruments</a> to co-founding
        <a href="https://snapeda.com">SnapEDA</a>, a <a href="https://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>-backed startup.
        I believe in leading through technical excellence and knowledge sharing. I created
        <a href="https://ironplc.com">IronPLC</a>, a Rust-based parser for industrial automation control,
        and actively contribute to open source projects that advance the broader engineering community.
    </p>

        I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science with a specialization in
        Machine Learning from the <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georgia Institute
        of Technology</a>. I also hold a BASc and MASc in Mechanical Engineering from the
        <a href="https://utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>. I've worked in
        Canada, the United States, and China.
