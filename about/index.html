        I am a Principal Engineer with two decades of experience designing and scaling
        critical software infrastructure, from low-level embedded systems to
        enterprise-wide distributed security. Currently at Amazon, I lead the technical
        strategy for the company's core non-person access control solution,
        including for agent actors.

        My professional journey has taken me from developing electronics and FPGA design tools
        at <a href="https://ni.com">National Instruments</a> to co-founding
        <a href="https://snapeda.com">SnapEDA</a>, a <a href="https://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>-backed startup.
        Throughout my career, I've been passionate about open source. I am the developer of
        <a href="https://ironplc.com">IronPLC</a>, a Rust-based parser for industrial automation control,
        and have contributed to other projects like OpenPLC.

    <p>
        I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science with a specialization in
        Machine Learning from the <a href="https://gatech.edu">Georgia Institute
        of Technology</a>. I also hold a BASc and MASc in Mechanical Engineering from the
        <a href="https://utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>. I've worked in
        Canada, the United States, and China.
