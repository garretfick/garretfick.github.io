I often find myself referring to these but sometimes forget the name. Now if
I could only remember I have a list...

## Ockham's razor or Principle of Parsimony

> Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity
>
> — William of Ockham

Often interpreted to mean "the simplest explanation is likely the right one".

## Conway's Law

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a
> design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
>
> — Melvin E. Conway

## The Rumpelstiltskin Principle

> As the 4,000 year old tale tells, once you have a name for something, you have power over it.

This feel highly related to the fundamental problems of computer science:

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
>
> — Phil Karlton

The vocabulary we use can restrict our ideas when we have the wrong words and
liberate them when we have the right words.

## Hyrum's Law

> With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you
> promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be
> depended on by somebody.
>
> — [Hyrum Wright](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/)

## Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only one reason to change
>
> Robert C. Martin

Often interpreted to mean that any entity (module, class, function) should have
responsibility over exactly one idea.

## Don't Repeat Yourself Principle

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
> representation within a system.
>
> — Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas

Never, ever, copy, code.
