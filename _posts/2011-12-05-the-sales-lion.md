I recently discovered [The Sales Lion](http://www.thesaleslion.com) thanks to [The Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-marketing/sales/how-to-come-up-with-100-ideas-to-create-content/article2239490/). Although I find his writing style uses a few too many exclamation marks, the site is a great collection of information about developing an online presence - whether as an individual or corporation.

If you're creating online content, you need to read his site. If you're not creating online content, you also need to read his site to find out why you should be. If you don't believe me, remember this. I'm a R&D person, and I'm recommending that you read something written by an evil marketing person. There must be something good there.
