title: Recharging a China Unicom Phone

*Note* It is much easier to recharge now via Alipay or Wechat pay, but not all foreigners have that setup quickly. I haven't tried this method in quite some time, so I hope it still works.

I wrote before that I decided to go with [China Unicom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Unicom) for cell phone service in China, primarily because they offer 3G which I use extensively, and I think I have a 1 year contract. (Oh the fun of not knowing what you have!)

About a month ago, I realized I had never received a bill for the service, which left me worried. Was the bill going to the wrong address? Was my cell phone service about to be cut off for non-payment? The answer for both is no. Even though I have a contract, I still pay for it similar to pay-as-you-go. I refill my phone every month to pay for the contract. Periodically, you need to add more money to your phone, and doing this is straightforward, once you know how.

## Check Your Balance

Checking your balance is straightforward and in English. From your cell phone, [call China Unicom at 10011](tel:10011) and follow the English prompts. (There is a lot of Chinese at the beginning, so be patient).

## Add Money

I've found two ways to add money to your phone. In either case, you'll need to tell the cashier China Unicom in Chinese: 中国联通 (zhongguo liantong). I usually go to [FamilyMart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FamilyMart) since it is close to where I live, but you can do this at many other places.

### Instant Charge

1. Go to most major convenience stores and tell them you want to add money: 加钱电话 (jia qian dianhua)
2. Pay for the recharge
3. The cashier will redirect you to a machine. Enter your phone number and press OK, then enter your phone number again and press OK
4. You should get a text message within a few seconds

### Recharge Card

1. Go to most convenience stores and buy the recharge card for China Unicom
2. [Call China Unicom at 10011](tel:10011) and follow the English prompts
