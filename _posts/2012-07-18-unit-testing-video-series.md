title: Unit Testing Video Series

A couple of months ago, I ran another video series at work, this time about unit testing. Honestly, this one was less interesting than the design video series. But this shouldn't be a surprise; designers tend to be more interesting speakers, and pictures tend to be more engaging that lines of code.

The series followed the Clean Code Talks by [Misko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/about/)

There were four in the series, and you can find them all on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com)

Although I am doing test driven development, I learned a lot, and have been very interested in programming without nulls.
