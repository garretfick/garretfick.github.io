This lesson is about how I helped a team come to consensus about tenets 

Amazon teams and organizations typically define tenets as a way
to accelerate decision making. Tenets are agreed beliefs that align
decision makers on what is important and how important beliefs 
are in contrast to other beliefs.

Tenets are especially powerful when the enable teams to make
decisions without everyone being present. We know the team will
make decisions consistent with the tenets.
Although tenets can be changed, they do not change often.

**Defining tenets is contentious.**

In essence, the team is making decisions to problems they have
yet to consider. This is both liberating and terrifying. I've both observed
teams use tenets to make decisions and also unable to come to consensus on tenets.

As a part of a three year strategy, I've been working with a team
to come to consensus on the team's tenets. To get the team started, I offered
a draft based on some principles the team had initially adopted but never
encoded as tenets. That sure generated discussion but not the discussion
that I intended. Instead of discussing "what should the tenets be", we
ended up with a dicussion about "what qualifies as tenets." Is there
tension in a tenet or between them?

The first meeting left me exhausted wondering how we will
ever agree on tenets if we cannot agree on what is a good tenet.

For the second meeting, I tried something different. Instead of starting
by reviewing what we had last time, I started by asking the team to
do a 30 min tenet training.

What a difference!

The initial training got the team on the same page. Instead
of discussing what is a good tenet, we talked about the content. We used
practices and ideas from the training to improve our earlier draft.

Coming to agreement here meant diagnosing the problem. The problem
wasn't about the team's beliefs - those didn't end up changing much. The
problem was coming to a common understanding of how we should express those
belief. The training we did during the meeting resolved the questions
about how we should express our beliefs letting the team talk about
the important part: what exacly are our beliefs.
