This lesson is about how I helped a team come to consensus about tenets 

Amazon teams and organizations typically define tenets as a way
to accelerate decision making. Tenets are agreed beliefs that align
decision makers on what is important and how important beliefs 
are in contrast to other beliefs.

Tenets are especially powerful when the enable teams to make
decisions without everyone being present. We know the team will
make decisions consistent with the tenets.
Although tenets can be changed, they do not change often.

**Defining tenets is contentious.**

In essence, the team is making decisions to problems they have
yet to consider. This is both liberating and terrifying. I've observed teams unable to come to consensus on tenets.
