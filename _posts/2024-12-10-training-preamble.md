Amazon teams and organizations typically define tenets as a way
to accelerate decision making. Tenets are agreed beliefs that align
decision makers on what is important and how important beliefs 
are in contrast to other beliefs.

Tenets are especially powerful when the enable teams to make
decisions without everyone being present. We know the team will
make decisions consistent with the tenets.
Although tenets can be changed, they do not change often.

Defining tenets tends to be contentious.

To some degree, the team is making decisions to problems they have
yet to consider.
