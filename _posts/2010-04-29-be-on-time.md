OK, so we recently interviewed 5 people for a position at work. One was 5-10 minutes late, and one was 40 minutes late. That's right, 40 minutes late. I don't understand how anyone can think this is acceptable. None of the late candidates were offered positions and being late was a significant discussion topic.

Now sometimes transit causes a problem, so we generally give benefit of doubt. In the case of the 40 minute late candidate, we gave him an opportunity explain before deciding we could not interview him. The explanation was unsatisfactory (a 15 minute delay does not lead to 40 minutes late unless you would have been late anyway). For myself, a 15 minute delay would never make me late for an interview anyway.

Interviewing is so frustrating.
