I read a descent amount and am often asked to recommend great books to read.
I'll try and share some of my all time favorites. (There is a bit of recency bias
because I can only recommend what I remember.)

**Books**

_Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies_ - Collins and Porras

One of the first business themed books I read in my career. This is where the
phrase "BHAG" originates and describes taking audacious goals.

_Crossing the Chasm - Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers_ - Moore

Provided my first insights into the technology adoption life cycle, from innovators
to laggards.

_The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail_ - Christensen

Case after case, described how leading companies fail to innovate. I also read
_The Innovator's Solution_ but what I remember if the first one.

_Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering_ - Brooks

It is a bit dated but still essential. "The Architect's Responsibility" comes from
there. My blog/telephone log is als from there.

_The Art of War_ - Sun Tzu (Kaufman translation)

Numerous insights into psychology and how opponents behave. My key insights were to
expect anything from your enemy and to always provide a way for your enemy to retreat.

_Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers_ - Jackall

Describes organizations as ruthless beings where everything you believed in can be
tossed to the wind in moment. Fabulous if you want to understand the experience
of being a manager or in a leadership position.

**Articles**

_How to Present to Senior Executives_ - Duarte (Harvard Business Review)

Executives don't have time. Get right to the point.

_The market for "lemons": Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism_ - Akerlog

Describes how quality and uncertainty affect each other. It is a classic paper in economics, but I feel it applies here because it influenced my thinking about
products.

_A typology of organisational cultures_ - Westrum

Describes how organization culture affects behavior and outcomes.

_The Core Competence of the Corporation_ - Prahalad and Hamel (Harvard Business Review)

Separates corporations into those with strategic business units and those with
core competencies. Makes the argument that organizations that identify their core 
competencies excel in comparison to those with strategic business units.

_How to Committees Invent?_ - Conway

Later became known as "Conway's Law" - the architecture that a company builds
is a reflection of the organizational structure.

_The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint_ - Tufte

After this, I finally understood why I so dislike bullet points.
