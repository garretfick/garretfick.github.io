AI is no longer just a buzzword—it’s reshaping how we work, create, and live. And as software engineers, we’re not just witnessing this change—we're helping to drive it.

Over the past year, I've had countless conversations with mentees and peers about what AI really means for our careers. On April 4, 2025, I had the opportunity to share some of these reflections during a speech at [East Side Toastmasters Club](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/6138-6138).

## Transcript

Arthur C. Clarke, one of the Big Three science fiction writers, once said that if an elderly but distinguished scientist claims something is possible, he is almost certainly right. But if he insists that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

We don’t have to look far for proof. In 1895, Lord Kelvin, a highly respected scientist, declared that “heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.” Eight years later, on December 17, 1903, the Wright brothers defied that prediction and took flight.

Tonight, I want to talk about another breakthrough—one that is reshaping our world in ways we’re only beginning to grasp: artificial intelligence. I’ll also share how I am personally adapting to this transformation—because whether we like it or not, AI is already changing the way we work and live.

### What is AI?

Seventy-four years ago, in 1956, John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" and defined it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. In essence, AI allows computers to perform tasks traditionally reserved for humans.

For decades, AI has been quietly working in the background—powering facial recognition, mapping, spam filters, and even maintaining power grids. But today, a new class of AI is causing a seismic shift: generative AI.

What makes generative AI different? Instead of just analyzing and predicting, it creates—text, images, code. And that changes everything.

Content generation is no longer exclusive to humans. AI is writing news articles, generating artwork, answering complex questions, even crafting stand-up comedy routines. According to the World Economic Forum, 41% of tech companies expect AI to reduce their workforce by 2030. And I’ve already seen firsthand how corporations are factoring AI into their hiring plans.

### How Do We Respond?

If your career revolves around text, images, or code, what do you do in the face of this disruption?

I believe there’s a three-step approach to staying ahead:

**Acquire Knowledge and Skills**

AI is like a toolbox—filled with hammers, screwdrivers, and saws. The first step is learning how to use them.

My introduction to AI was simple. “Give me feedback on my resume.” “Check this document for grammar errors.” The results were good, but not spectacular.

Then I realized: better prompts lead to better results. Instead of saying:
"Find the typos in this document,"
I tried:
"You are a junior engineer studying this document to learn lessons for your career. Identify difficult sections and suggest clearer alternatives. Also, find typos and grammatical errors that affect readability."
The difference was striking. AI is only as effective as the way we use it.

**Adapt**
Once you understand the tools, the next step is applying them.

Think of a carpenter building a shelf. The first attempt? Uneven cuts, wobbly joints. But with time and adaptation, the craftsmanship improves. The same applies to AI.

Interestingly, increased efficiency doesn’t always reduce demand—it often creates more. It’s called Jevon’s Paradox—where improving efficiency leads to greater resource consumption. Highways with more lanes attract more traffic. AI, used well, increases productivity.

I’ve started using AI to generate ideas, draft content, even debug code. It’s not perfect. Sometimes it makes things up—but instead of seeing this as a flaw, I treat it like supervising a junior engineer. AI generates, and I refine.

**Imagine**

The last step is the most exciting. We imagine.

The carpenter, having mastered building shelves, imagines building a lighter than air flying machine. Imagination is difficult and we may not get things right the first time. But the upside is enormous. The first transatlantic flight was 16 years after the first flight.

A year ago, when I wrote my icebreaker speech, I would have considered using AI to be irresponsible.

Today, I believe it would be irresponsible not to.

### Final Thoughts

This shift is just beginning, and those who embrace it—who acquire, adapt, and imagine—will be the ones who thrive.

So the real question isn’t whether AI will change our world. It already is.

The question is: how will you change with it?
