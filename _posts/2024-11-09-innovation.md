title: Leading Innovation

This week, I had the privilege of attending a hand-on workshop about
leading innovation. It was a packed 3-day schedule and I learned a lot
both from the material and from the exercises.

My motivation for attending was a message that I've heard from the teams
I work with. The engineers on the team regularly communicate that we
are not very innovative. This is feedback comes despite the reality that
these teams have submitted multiple patent applications! I had two
hypotheses as to why we receive this message
and I wanted to understand better what is the reasons the engineers report
that our teams are not innovative. Is it that we are not very innovative or
that we perceive we are not innovative (or some combination).

A little team context helps here.  These teams are responsible for foundational
security capabilities - we are one of the teams that most engineers have heard of.
These teams normally move slowly because mistakes have very large blast radius. I
often tell people that "our teams only make big mistakes." By moving slowly,
it can feel that we are not very innovative because we only make a few changes
each year. From that perspective, it sure seems that we are not innovating a lot.
However, these few change are often very high impact. From that perspective,
it sure seems that the things we do are innovative.

I think it is important to address the feedback, irrespective of whether 
the low degree of innovation is fact or perception. I'd like to share here two
key ideas from the workshop.

## What is Innovation

The first part of the workshop focused on defining innovation. This part was helpful
because it directly addresses a core question I had. Is the feedback about lacking
innovation a question of fact or perception?

We talked about a few frameworks for describing innovations. I think one of them
was particularly relevant for my objective: things and methods.

<table>
    <tr><td></td><th colspan="2">Things</th></tr>
    <tr><th rowspan="2">Methods</th><td>old/old<br/></td><td>old/new<br/></td></tr>
    <tr><td>new/old<br/></td><td>new/new<br/>invent</td></tr>
</table>

The claim being made is that innovation does not necessarily imply invention. Invention,
using new methods to do new things, is only one form of innovation. Re-purposing, using old
methods to new new things, is also innovative. Indeed, enough small incremental improvements,
old methods to do old things, over time can also be innovative.

This leads me to believe that we can help teams understand where we are being
innovative by recognizing and rewarding forms of innovation beyond invention.

## Environments for Innovation

The second part of the workshop focused on creating an environment that generates
innovation. This part reinforced some ideas that I already had - namely that environments
can both foster and kill innovation.

The essential idea is that a psychological safe environment is a necessary (but not
sufficient) ingredient to foster innovation. The actions of leaders have an important
effect on creating the right environment.

Many of us have probably observed "predatory questions". Predatory questions are those
designed to elicit a particular pre-determined outcome that the leader has decided
is the right answer. This is much like how lawyers attempt trap witnesses to achieve
a particular pre-determined outcome.

These lines of questions destroy trust because the effort is not to seek truth. Those
using such questions destroy the safety of the environment and kill the possibility of
innovation.

A strategy I've taken with teams I work with is to hold a regularly time where the
team members can present any idea. I commit myself, and remind others at the start
of the session, that the purpose of the session is to encourage innovation. We hold
a low bar for bringing the idea and we will focus our group effort on discovering
truths together. An idea from the workshop that I'll take back to this meeting is
"what has to be true for me to say yes to the idea."
