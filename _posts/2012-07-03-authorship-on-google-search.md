title: Authorship on Google Search

I've recently been investigating how to better attribute articles on this blog to myself as the author. I know I write them, but how do I communicate that to the rest of the world?

One way is to use microformats and [semantic web techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), but even for my small website, that would be a time consuming change. There is however, one small and easy thing you can do to improve attribution in Google search results.

Google will show [Google+](https://plus.google.com/) profile information for articles you publish, if you provide a link on the page to the Google+ profile (and complete a few other steps). You can find all of the details on [Google](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=1408986), but for me, this amounted to 5 minutes of work.

1. Add a link on the page to your Google+ profile, with the tag ?rel=author, for example https://plus.google.com/115055615462502452987?rel=author
2. Verify your email at [https://plus.google.com/authorship](https://plus.google.com/authorship) 3. Verify everything is working at [http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets)

Hopefully Google will soon display results with my picture.
