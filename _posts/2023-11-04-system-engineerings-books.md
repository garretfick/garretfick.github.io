One of my favorite topics is the behavior of medium sized systems. Medium sized systems
are those that are too big for analytical techniques and too small for statistical
techniques. There are lots of such systems.

The resources below are my favorites about systems and the subgenre of how they fail.

**Grand Prize**


_How Complex Systems Fail_ - Cook

A set of 18 rules about systems. Cook is writing about the medical field
but the lessons are broadly applicable.

**Books**

_An Introduction to General Systems Thinking_ - Weinberg

This book taught me that "medium sized" systems exist. It gave me a precise
definition of Murphy's Law and a multitude of other principles.

_Normal Accidents_ - Perrow

Discusses how systems interact to create risks. There are two kinds interactions
(complex and linear) and there are two kinds of coupling (tight and coupling).
I think there are good parallels in software, such as error handling strategies.

_Thinking in Systems_ - Meadows

Introduces the concept of flows and stocks. The most important ideas are in the
first few chapters.

**Articles**

_On Being the Right Size_ - Haldane

I came across this in part by trying to find the origin of the "incommensurate scaling law."
The essential idea is that working systems have just the right size across many dimensions.

_Architecture of Complexity_ - Simon

Complexity is hierarchical. What I enjoyed most was the diverse set of examples.
