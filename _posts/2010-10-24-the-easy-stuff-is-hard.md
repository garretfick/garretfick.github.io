title: The Easy Stuff is Hard
date: 2010-10-24

I've been working on an application to sell through the Android Market since the middle of the summer. Life got a little busy, so there were a couple of months when I didn't make much progress, but over the last few weeks, I've been really pushing myself to finish the project.

The project is near complete, but I'm stuck on two things: a name and an icon. Learning the Android platform, remembering Java, writing the code were all nothing compared to actually coming up with a good name for the application. Sometimes the easy stuff is so hard.
