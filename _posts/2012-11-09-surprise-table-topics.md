title: Surprise Table Topics
date: 2012-11-09

After finding out that our table topics member was in the hospital with appendix problems (how selfish!), I had to quickly come up with some table topics. Thankfully, Abby provided some help.

Starting from most recent, we worked backwards in history though questions asked to the [Dear Abby](http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/) column. Some of the questions were long, so to speed things up, I paraphrased the questions. This gave up interesting topics such as [Smothering mom looks for way to break free from her habit](http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/?uc_full_date=20120911)
 or [Angry teens turn down mom's proposed stepdad](http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/?uc_full_date=20120910)
 
If I had to do the topics again, I would paraphrase them better, but then, having more then 30s to prepare would help too.
