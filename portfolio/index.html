    <div>Globally diverse and distributed teams are different from those that are 
        located together. With technology and business leadership experience in the US, Canada,
        China and working with teams spread across the globe, I bring a wealth of
        nuanced experience.

    <div><i class="fa fa-wrench fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i><strong>Technology</strong></div>
    <div>I combine both an engineering background and a passion for everything computing.
        I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000902183420/http://www.geocities.com:80/CapeCanaveral/Hall/3230/">my first website</a>
        around 1997. Since then, I have developed technologies for embedded systems,
        desktop applications, mobile and back to web and cloud.

    <div><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i><strong>Vision</strong></div>
    <div>Vision is one part instinct and two parts engagement. Filtering out the hype
        is often more important than catching early trends. In addition to leading
        research in multiple roles, I've also developed novel technologies to give
        companies a competitive edge.

        At Amazon, I lead a team that secures micro-service messaging between
        a very large number of micro-services that execute on a staggering
        number of execution instances.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Smarter Grid Solutions, I lead advances in industrial IoT for Smart Grids
        from the perspectives of implementation and standardization. I developed the first
        strategy for contributing to open source software and application of threat modeling
        approaches to understanding security.
    </p>
    <p>
        At ChinaNetCloud, I directly managed a team of up to 10 people, interfacing
        between the founder and the core development group. I helped navigate
        through multiple restructuring events.
    </p>
    <p>
        At SnapEDA, I built an effective international R&amp;D team consisting of
        developers, UX, electrical engineers and other domain experts. The team
        organized around Kanban boards, allowing me to spend time understanding
        our customers.

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        Process is the way software development teams and stakeholders organize in order to achieve
        objectives.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
    <p class="admonition">
        As the CTO at SnapEDA, I implemented
        a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban-based</a>
        process using Trello for all R&amp;D tasks. The process is <a href="https://www.ficksworkshop.com/blog/practical-trello-for-small-team-software-development">
        detailed on my blog</a>, with example boards in Trello. I also transformed the development
        process, eliminating the need to test in production by developing automated build,
        test environments.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
    <p class="admonition">
        At ChinaNetCloud, I drove experimentation with several Agile processes, including
        Scrum and Kanban over a half year, eventually settling on Kanban as the best
        process to support stakeholder objectives, especially a desire to release often.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognizing the need for the startup to be able to respond quickly to validated
        learning and move quickly, I directed the team to progressively reducing the release
        cadence, starting from every two weeks and ending at multiple times a week through
        a steady focus on reducing friction in the software development process.

    <h3>Languages</h3>
    <p>
        Software isn't about the language - it is about the ideas and the language is how you express
        your ideas in a concrete way. Still, it is one of the first questions we ask.

    <p>
        Industrial software systems are often neglected and the tools and systems
        often have only rudimentary support for software engineering's best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Smarter Grid Solutions, we are transforming our software development process
        for embedded devices to take full advantage of best practices. For our differentiated
        control applications, we have developed fully automated pipelines that take
        <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html">Simulink-defined state
        machines</a> and enable developers to compose solutions and
        automatically deploy then on all major PLC runtimes.
    </p>
    <p>The result? An efficient platform for embedded systems innovation.</p>

    <p class="admonition">SnapEDA - Part Validations</p>
    <p>
        Details in circuit board manufacturing are absolutely critical. Sub-millimeter mistakes 
        can result in poor soldering, bad boards, or even boards that are impossible to assemble.
        This presents a barrier to acquiring data from 3rd parties such as SnapEDA.
    </p>
    <p>
        At SnapEDA, I invented a patented verification system that identifies data problems.
        What makes this powerful was recognizing that the same information is often specified
        in multiple ways that should be self-consistent. The verification system is able to 
        answer the question of "does this make sense?" and present the results in an
        easy-to-understand format.

    <p class="admonition">ChinaNetCloud - Adoption of React</p>
    <p>
        OpsStack is ChinaNetCloud's Operations as a Service (OaaS) stack management system.
        As the software architect, I recognized that jQuery was not going to be an efficient
        way to develop and maintain future requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        I evaluated several frameworks, ultimately selecting <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>
        over alternatives such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and others. This
        evaluation included a migration strategy so that we could change the front end piecewise
        and training plans for developers.
    </p>

        I have spoken about the migration in
