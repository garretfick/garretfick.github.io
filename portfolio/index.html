            <div>Globally diverse and distributed teams are different from those that are 
                located together. With technology and business leadership experience in Canada,
                China and the US working with teams spread across the globe, I bring a wealth of
                nuanced experience.

            <div>I combine both an engineering background and a passion for everything computing.
                In fact, I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000902183420/http://www.geocities.com:80/CapeCanaveral/Hall/3230/">my first website</a>
                around 1997. Since then, I have developed technologies for embedded systems,
                desktop applications, mobile and back to web and cloud.

            <div><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i><strong>Vision</strong></div>
            <div>Vision is one part instinct and two parts engagement. Filtering out the hype
                is often more important than catching early trends. In addition to leading
                research in multiple roles, I've also developed novel technologies to give
                companies a competitive edge.

                At ChinaNetCloud, I directly managed a team of up to 10 people, interfacing
                between the founder and the core development group. I help navigate
                through multiple restructuring events.
            </p>
            <p>
                At SnapEDA, I built an effective international R&amp;D team consisting of
                developers, UX, electrical engineers and other domain experts. The team
                organized around Kanban boards, allowing me to spend time understanding
                our customers.

        <p>
            Process is the way software development teams and stakeholders organize in order to achieve
            objectives.

                As the CTO at SnapEDA, I implemented
                a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban-based</a>
                process using Trello for all R&amp;D tasks. The process is <a href="https://www.ficksworkshop.com/blog/practical-trello-for-small-team-software-development">
                detailed on my blog</a>, with example boards in Trello. I also transformed the development
                process, eliminating the need to test in production by developing automated build,
                test environments.

                At ChinaNetCloud, I drove experimentation with several Agile processes, including
                Scrum and Kanban over a half year, eventually settling on Kanban as the best
                process to support stakeholder objectives, especially a desire to release often.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognizing the need for the startup to be able to respond quickly to validated
                learning and move quickly, I directed the team to progressively reducing the release
                cadence, starting from every two weeks and ending at multiple times a week through
                a steady focus on reducing friction in the software development process.

            <p>
                Software isn't about the language - it is about the ideas and the language is how you express
                your ideas in a concrete way. Still, it is one of the first questions we ask.

                Industrial software systems are often neglected and the tools and systems

                At Smarter Grid Solutions, we are transforming our software development process
                for embedded devices to take full advantage of best practices. For our differentiated
                control applications, we have developed fully automated pipelines that take
                <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html">Simulink-defined state
                machines</a> and enable developers to compose solutions and

            <p>SnapEDA - Part Validations</p>
            <p>
                Details in circuit board manufacturing are absolutely critical. Sub-millimeter mistakes 
                can result in poor soldering, bad boards, or even boards that are impossible to assemble.
                This presents a barrier to acquiring data from 3rd parties such as SnapEDA.
            </p>
            <p>
                At SnapEDA, I invented a patent-pending verification system that identifies data problems.
                What makes this powerful was recognizing that the same information is often specified
                in multiple ways that should be self-consistent. The verification system is able to 
                answer the question of "does this make sense?" and present the results in an
                easy-to-understand format.

            <p>ChinaNetCloud - Adoption of React</p>

                OpsStack is ChinaNetCloud's Operations as a Service (OaaS) stack management system.
                As the software architect, I recognized that jQuery was not going to be an efficient
                way to develop and maintain future requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I evaluated several frameworks, ultimately selecting <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>
                over alternatives such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and others. This
                evaluation included a migration strategy so that we could change the front end piecewise
                and training plans for developers.
